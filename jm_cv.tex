{\bf The Role of Uncertainty in Education Mismatch} \\ (Job Market Paper)

In many developed economies, there is both a high share of students selecting into higher education (HE) and a large share of graduates who end up working in non-graduate occupations. Does this mean that the level of education is inefficiently high? In this paper, I propose an explanation of overeducation based on the observation that the causal effect of HE on human capital is both heterogeneous and imperfectly observed by the student. I propose a model in which workers first decide whether to invest in higher education on the basis of limited information, and then match to jobs in a labour market. In this setting, workers could be over-educated if they do not benefit from HE after attending, and under-educated if they could have benefited but did not attend HE. Structurally estimating my model on UK data, I calculate that 18.2\% of the population are over-educated and 14.7\% are under-educated. In general, the equilibrium in the model is inefficient, because of a hold-up externality which causes under-investment and a congestion externality which causes over-investment. These externalities offset each other, and in general, it is ambiguous whether the level of education is inefficiently high or low.

\begin{rSection}{Working Papers}
{\bf The Butcher, the Brewer, or the Baker: The Role of Occupations in Explaining Wage Inequality} \\ (with Luke Heath Milsom)

Google does not pay its canteen chefs the same premium as it does its software engineers; there is heterogeneity in pay premia within a firm. To study the implications of this observation, we estimate a two-way, worker-job, fixed effect model that builds upon the canonical model by Abowd et al. (1999) by allowing for within-firm heterogeneity. Estimating our model on UK administrative data, we find that even if workers, and firms, were identical, 25\% of current log-wage variance would remain, due solely to heterogeneity between occupations. We further document that worker heterogeneity accounts for a relatively small proportion of log-wage variance, and that between-firm pay heterogeneity is more important in higher-wage occupations and larger labour markets.

{\bf Determinants of University Subject Choice in the UK}

Students applying to British universities have to choose to specialise in a particular subject at the point of application. What factors play into their choice of subject of study? I analyse students' subject choices in university using a cohort panel dataset (LSYPE), and in particular, whether those choices respond to their expected wages conditional on studying the subject. I find that earnings, defined as earnings at age 25 or as lifetime earnings, are positively associated with choice probability, although the quantitative impact of expected earnings on subject choice is small. I also find that there are substantial differences in choice probability between students of different sexes, ethnicities and to a lesser extent, socio-economic classes.
